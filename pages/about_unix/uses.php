        <h1>Why Use Unix?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Unix makes a great platform for utility servers such as Domain Name System,
            or DNS, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, and Web servers. Its lean
            architecture preserves resources for the actual applications that you want to run,
            rather than consuming them just to boot the operating system itself. Unix also provides
            a stable and secure platform for applications that do not require direct user interaction
            with the operating system. </p>
