        <h1>What makes Unix so Great?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Unix was developed using a high-level programming language (C) instead of platform-specific assembly language,
            enabling its portability across multiple computer platforms. Unix also was developed as a self-contained software
            system, comprising the operating system, development environment, utilities, documentation, and modifiable source code.
            These key factors led to widespread use and further development in commercial settings, and helped Unix and its variants
            become an important teaching and learning tool used in academic settings.
