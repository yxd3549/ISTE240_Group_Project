        <h1>What Even is Unix?</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Unix (officially UNIX) is a registered trademark of The Open Group that refers to a family of
            computer operating systems and tools conforming to The Open Group Base Specification, Issue 7
            (also known as POSIX.1-2008 or IEEE Std 1003.1 - 2008). To use the Unix trademark, an operating
            system vendor must pay a licensing fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group. Officially
            licensed Unix operating systems (and their vendors) include OS X (Apple), Solaris (Oracle), AIX (IBM),
            IRIX (SGI), and HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard). </p><br/>

            <aside>Note:<br/>Operating systems that behave like Unix systems and provide similar utilities, but do not conform to Unix
                specification or are not licensed by The Open Group, are commonly known as Unix-like systems. These include
                a wide variety of Linux distributions (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, and CentOS) and several descendants
                of the Berkeley Software Distribution operating system (e.g., FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD).
